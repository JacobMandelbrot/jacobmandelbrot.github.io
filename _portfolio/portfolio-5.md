- Implemented Co-op functionality which required replicating key variables and functions to make sure that changes on the server were reflected across all clients.
- Made a variety of weapons and enemies that have a rock paper scissors relationship. Each enemy feels unique and has a distinct weakness (Ex. flying enemy weak to homing missile, tanky/slow enemy weak to shotgun).
- Also made a boss enemy combines different aspects from the normal enemies
- Created system for stealing abilities and using them to shoot a weapon or build a tower
- Made vampire survivor system for leveling to give players a sense of progression.
- Integrated animation pack giving player character realistic movement and a weapon animations
- Made two plugins, a plugin which adds a blueprint node with c++ line tracing and enemy detection functionality and a button in the editor which cycles between a few behind-the-scenes ability and enemy presets
