Created visual scripting language that executes from left to right and was made to be easy to learn for someone with little coding experience
Replicated recursion functionality by pushing and popping array lists from a stack in C#. Furthermore, visualized recursion to execute one run through at a time, making it easier to see how recursion works
Used visual scripting language to create several levels with increasing difficulty and unique and complicated fractals
