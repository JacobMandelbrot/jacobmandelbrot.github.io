- Created visual scripting language that executes from left to right. It was made to be easy to learn for someone with little coding experience
- Replicated recursion functionality by pushing and popping array lists from a stack in C#. Furthermore, by making the code execute step by step, it became easier to see how recursion worked visually
- Used visual scripting language to create several levels with a variety of fractals that gradually increased in difficulty
