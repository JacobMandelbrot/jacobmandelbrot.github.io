Created for Harvard Undergraduate Video Game Development Club 12 hour game jam (theme was commiting a crime) and won first place. Stealth/Puzzle game with loose inspiration from Metal Gear Solid.

- Created advanced enemy AI system that uses a state machine to switch between multiple states such as patrolling, chasing, and firing.
- Created player character and controller selfie stick tool which required lots of experimenting and learning about the relationship between transforms of child/parent objects.
- Learned to break problems into smaller pieces to finish them quicker and how to make efficient use of time under high time pressure.
- Made in Unity
