I am a Harvard student studying Computer Science with a strong passion for all aspects of game development and a main focus in programming.
Although I have a demanding course schedule, I find time to devote to game development and improve my skills with Unreal Engine and Unity. My strengths as a
game developer are combining different mechanics, navigating through complex problems, and creating balanced enemy AI. Below is a link to a portfolio of 5 games
that I made in Unreal and Unity which have been major learning experiences as well as great opportunities to design interesting games!
