&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Harvard student studying Computer Science with a strong passion for game development. Although I have a demanding course schedule, I find time to devote to game development and improve my skills with Unreal Engine and Unity. My strengths as a game developer are creating complex and balanced enemy AI, building out player mechanics and abilities, and breaking down and solving difficult problems. Recently, I co-founded a game studio at Harvard and have been working with people across multiple disciplines to release a professional game. Through this experience, I have grown significantly as a developer, and it has deepened my passion for making games.
