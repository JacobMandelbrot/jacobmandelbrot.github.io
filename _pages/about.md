&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Harvard student studying Computer Science with a strong passion for making games. Although I have a demanding course schedule, I find time to devote to game development and improve my skills with Unreal Engine and Unity. My strengths as a game developer are creating complex and balanced enemy AI, building out player mechanics and abilities, and breaking down and solving difficult problems. At Harvard, I joined a small team of fellow students as the lead programmer, working collaboratively with individuals from various disciplines to develop and release a professional game. Through this experience, I have grown significantly as a developer, and it has deepened my passion for making games.
